- name: Scaling Package Queries to Millions of Tuples
  url: https://github.com/alm818/PackageQuery
  description: The project focuses on package queries, a type of high-order query that looks for an answer set that collectively satisfies a global predicate while optimizing for an objective function. We perform a offline partitioning on the relation using K-D Tree and a heuristic called SketchRefine that constructs a package using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation. We are able to answer package queries on the relation with 10-100 million tuples.
